So you want to contribute to SCHNAIL localization.

Grab the messages_en.properties file, and translate the text into the preferred language. Make a messages_xy.properties file, and make a PR with it. 
The version should be the version of the messages_en. The language_localname is the target language's name in that language, like Deutsch
for German.

Thanks for your contribution!
